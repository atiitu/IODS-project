In this week's excersize we'll analyze data on student's alcohol
consumption. It is combined from two questionnaires originally downloaded from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance#

```{r echo=FALSE}
setwd("~/Tyojuttuja/opinnot/GitHub/IODS-project/data")
alc <- read.table(file ="~/Tyojuttuja/opinnot/GitHub/IODS-project/data/student_alc.txt", sep= "\t")
```
Data contains 382 observations (students) of a total of 35 variables, which are listed below:

```{r echo=FALSE}
colnames(alc)
```
The variables are:

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
