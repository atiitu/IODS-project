```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```


In this week's excersize we'll analyze data on student's alcohol
consumption. It is combined from two questionnaires originally downloaded from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance#

```{r echo=FALSE}
setwd("~/Tyojuttuja/opinnot/GitHub/IODS-project/data")
alc <- read.table(file ="~/Tyojuttuja/opinnot/GitHub/IODS-project/data/student_alc.txt", sep= "\t")
```
Data contains 382 observations (students) of a total of 35 variables, which are listed below:

```{r echo=FALSE}
colnames(alc)
```
***********************************************************************
The variables are:<br/>

1 school - student's school (binary: "GP" - Gabriel Pereira or "MS" - Mousinho da Silveira)<br/>
2 sex - student's sex (binary: "F" - female or "M" - male)<br/>
3 age - student's age (numeric: from 15 to 22)<br/>
4 address - student's home address type (binary: "U" - urban or "R" - rural)<br/>
5 famsize - family size (binary: "LE3" - less or equal to 3 or "GT3" - greater than 3)<br/>
6 Pstatus - parent's cohabitation status (binary: "T" - living together or "A" - apart)<br/>
7 Medu - mother's education (numeric: 0 - none,  1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 - 5th to 9th grade, 3 - secondary education or 4 - higher education)<br/>
8 Fedu - father's education (numeric: 0 - none,  1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 - 5th to 9th grade, 3 - secondary education or 4 - higher education)<br/>
9 Mjob - mother's job (nominal: "teacher", "health" care related, civil "services" (e.g. administrative or police), "at_home" or "other")<br/>
10 Fjob - father's job (nominal: "teacher", "health" care related, civil "services" (e.g. administrative or police), "at_home" or "other")<br/>
11 reason - reason to choose this school (nominal: close to "home", school "reputation", "course" preference or "other")<br/>
12 guardian - student's guardian (nominal: "mother", "father" or "other")<br/>
13 traveltime - home to school travel time (numeric: 1 - <15 min., 2 - 15 to 30 min., 3 - 30 min. to 1 hour, or 4 - >1 hour)<br/>
14 studytime - weekly study time (numeric: 1 - <2 hours, 2 - 2 to 5 hours, 3 - 5 to 10 hours, or 4 - >10 hours)<br/>
15 failures - number of past class failures (numeric: n if 1<=n<3, else 4)<br/>
16 schoolsup - extra educational support (binary: yes or no)<br/>
17 famsup - family educational support (binary: yes or no)<br/>
18 paid - extra paid classes within the course subject (Math or Portuguese) (binary: yes or no)<br/>
19 activities - extra-curricular activities (binary: yes or no)<br/>
20 nursery - attended nursery school (binary: yes or no)<br/>
21 higher - wants to take higher education (binary: yes or no)<br/>
22 internet - Internet access at home (binary: yes or no)<br/>
23 romantic - with a romantic relationship (binary: yes or no)<br/>
24 famrel - quality of family relationships (numeric: from 1 - very bad to 5 - excellent)<br/>
25 freetime - free time after school (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)<br/>
26 goout - going out with friends (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)<br/>
27 Dalc - workday alcohol consumption (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)<br/>
28 Walc - weekend alcohol consumption (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)<br/>
29 health - current health status (numeric: from 1 - very bad to 5 - very good)<br/>
30 absences - number of school absences (numeric: from 0 to 93)<br/>

these grades are related with the course subject, Math or Portuguese:
31 G1 - first period grade (numeric: from 0 to 20)<br/>
32 G2 - second period grade (numeric: from 0 to 20)<br/>
33 G3 - final grade (numeric: from 0 to 20, output target)<br/>
34 alc_use - average alcohol use on weekdays and weekends (variable created from averagin Dalc and Walc)<br/>
35 high_use - TRUE or FALSE if the use of alchol is >2 (variable created in create_alc.R)<br/>
******************************************************************<br/>

With this data, I will analyze how going out with friends (goout), mother's education (Medu), father's education (Fedu
+) and final grade (G3) associate with the use of alcohol (low or high). I hypothesize that:<br/>
-those that go more out with friends think more alcohol<br/>
-low mother and father education associate with higher alcohol use<br/>
-those that drink more have lower final grade.

Going out:<br/>

As hypothesized, 60% of those that are going out with frends the most (5 on 1-5 scale) are high users of alcohol (>2 on 1-5 scale). Of those that go out the least (1), only 13,6% are high alcohol users.

```{r}
library(dplyr); library(ggplot2)
mytable <- table(high_use = alc$high_use, going_out = alc$goout)
prop.table(mytable, 2)
```

mother's and father's education
```{r}
mytable <- table(high_use = alc$high_use, mothers_education = alc$Medu)
prop.table(mytable, 2)
```
```{r}
mytable <- table(high_use = alc$high_use, fathers_education = alc$Fedu)
prop.table(mytable, 2)
```

final grades:
```{r}
# initialize a plot of high_use and G3
g1 <- ggplot(alc, aes(x = high_use, y = G3))

# define the plot as a boxplot and draw it
g1 + geom_boxplot() + ylab("final grade (points)") + xlab("high-user of alcohol")
```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
