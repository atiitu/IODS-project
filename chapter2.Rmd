# Regression and model validation

##The very basics of R was described in the first excersizes.

I learned for example
-that R can work as a simple calculator
-a couple of basic options to study data (str, head, mean -fuctions etc)

##The most important topic was different data types in R:

-numeric
-logical
-character
-factors (stored as numeric but levels can be non-numeric)

I also learned how to create simple data structures of different types. What I need to remember, is that when creating a character-vector, "" are needed: data <- c("mina", "sina", "han")
