#Read in and study data

First, I changed the working directory where the data is.
The data is in .txt -format and is tab-separated.

```{r} 
data <- read.table(file = "learning2014.txt", sep="\t")
```

The data table was studied:
```{r} 
str(data)
head(data)
dim(data)
```
In this dataset, there are 166 rows and 7 columns:
gender, age, attitude, deep, stra, surf, points.
Attitude is the learning attitude (1-5) and deep, stra and surf are means of different kind of learning-related questions (scales 1-5). Points-column is the points got from the exam.

Please find more detail about the data in here
