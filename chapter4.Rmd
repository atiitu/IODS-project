#Week4: Clustering and classification

**Exploring Boston-data**

For this week's excersize we'll use a Boston-dataset included in the MASS Package in R. Basically, the data is about per capita crime rate by town and some variables describing the towns. There are 14 variables on 506 towns included.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results=FALSE}
library(MASS)
data("Boston")
#14 variables, 506 observations
# explore the dataset
str(Boston)
summary(Boston)
```



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
